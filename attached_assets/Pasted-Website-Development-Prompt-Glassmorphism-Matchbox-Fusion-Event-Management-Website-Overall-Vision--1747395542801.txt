Website Development Prompt: Glassmorphism Matchbox~Fusion Event Management Website
Overall Vision
Create a premium event management website with a dark glassmorphism UI theme featuring 3D elements and animations. The website should have a sophisticated, modern aesthetic with floating glass-like panels, subtle purple/blue gradient backgrounds, and interactive animated elements.

Design Direction
Base Theme: Dark mode with deep navy/purple background featuring subtle cosmic/nebula elements similar to the Reflect website in the reference image
UI Style: Implement glassmorphism design throughout - semi-transparent frosted glass panels with light borders, subtle shadows, and blur effects
Color Palette:
Primary: Deep purples, blues, and blacks for backgrounds
Accent: Glowing purples, blues, and subtle whites for highlights
Text: White and light gray for maximum readability against dark backgrounds
3D Elements:
Floating emoji-like 3D objects with subtle glow effects (similar to the smiling faces in the reference image)
3D animated wave or portal effect in the hero section (similar to the purple light portal in the Reflect website)
Floating 3D cards with glass effect that respond to mouse movement

Animation Requirements
Micro-interactions: Subtle animations for all interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields)
Scroll Animations: Elements should fade/slide in as user scrolls down the page
Background Animation: Slow-moving gradient or particle effect in the background
Text Animation: Key headings should have subtle animation effects (gradient shifts, glowing)
Cursor Effects: Custom cursor with trail effect and interactive glow when hovering over clickable elements
Technical Requirements
Responsive design that maintains the glassmorphism effect across all devices
Optimized loading for 3D elements to ensure smooth performance
Progressive enhancement to ensure basic functionality on older browsers
Accessibility considerations despite the dark theme and complex visual effects
Smooth scrolling and page transitions
Content Integration
Maintain all the original content from the reference site (http://9079703080.renderforestsites.com/) but enhance the presentation with the new design direction:

Keep all service descriptions, testimonials, and company information
Maintain the "Our Story" and service sections but with upgraded visual presentation
Preserve the call-to-action elements but redesign them with the glassmorphism effect
This website should create an immersive, premium experience that showcases Matchbox~Fusion as an innovative, high-end event management service through its cutting-edge design while maintaining exceptional usability
